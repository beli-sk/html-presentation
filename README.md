Copy ``template.html`` to ``01.html``, ``02.html``, etc. for each slide and edit.
Then edit some settings in ``js/conf.js``.

Open the first (or any other) slide in a web browser.
Navigate slides with on-screen links (hover over the footer area) or left/right arrow keys.

Switch your browser to fullscreen (F11 in Firefox) for best effect.
